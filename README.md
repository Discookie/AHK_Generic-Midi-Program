Generic Midi Program (originally from 2010) Ansi 32bit ahk version 
  Basic structural framework for a midi program in ahk.
  The description of what this is for is contained in the first post on the topic Midi Input/Output Combined at the ahk forum.
  Please read it, if you want to know more.
  I have added a few more examples for different midi data types as well as more, meaningful (I hope), documentation to the script.
  You are strongly encouraged to visit http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midimessages.php (decimal values), to learn more 
  about midi data.  It will help you create your own midi rules.
  
  I have combined much of the work of others here.
  It is a working script, most of the heavy lifing has been done for you.
  You will need to create your own midi rules. 
  By creating or modifying if statements, in the section of the MidiRules.ahk file.
  By creating hotkeys that generate midi messages in the hotkeyTOmidi.ahk file.
  
  I don't claim to be an expert on this, just a guy who pulled disparate things together.
